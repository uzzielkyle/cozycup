      <p class="mb-6">
        CozyCup was born out of curiosity for exceptional coffee and a passion for creating a space where community and comfort come together. Our journey began in the heart of a small town, where our founder, Uzziel, transformed an old, charming brick building into a cozy haven for coffee lovers.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        From the very beginning, we were driven by a simple philosophy: to offer the finest coffee made from carefully sourced beans, roasted to perfection. Our dedication to quality and sustainability has been at the core of everything we do, from the selection of our suppliers to the brewing methods we use in our café.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, CozyCup is more than just a place to grab a cup of coffee. It's a reflection of our values, a place where every visitor feels at home, surrounded by the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the warmth of a welcoming atmosphere.
